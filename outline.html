            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <p>
                This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills to build web applications 
                using web technologies. You'll work individually and in teams to tackle real-world 
                web development challenges, building proficiency in selecting and applying suitable 
                tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential aspects of security, ethics, 
                accessibility, and professional communication within web development. Guidance 
                from an academic facilitator will support you in mastering both technical skills and 
                collaborative project management techniques to achieve these objectives.
